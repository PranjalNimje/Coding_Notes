What Is Inheritance?

Different kinds of objects often have a certain amount in common with each other.

Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes. 
Bicycle now becomes the superclass of MountainBike, RoadBike, and TandemBike.

Bicycle 
	MountainBike  
	RoadBike	- all share the characteristics of bicycles 
	TandemBike.	  (current speed, current pedal cadence, current gear). 

Mountain bikes, road bikes, and tandem bikes, for example, all share the characteristics of bicycles (current speed, current pedal cadence, current gear). 
Yet each also defines additional features that make them different:

Each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, 
and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses:	


syntax -
The syntax for creating a subclass is simple.
At the beginning of your class declaration, use the extends keyword,
followed by the name of the class to inherit from:

class MountainBike extends Bicycle 


Subclass inherits all the fields and methods of superclass
and we can add additional, unique features too
