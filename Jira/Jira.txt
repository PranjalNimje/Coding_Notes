Agile board-
Ex of agile board
ToDO  InProgress  Done

In agile board we have different columns
Steps we need to get project done


Agile --Scrum
	--Kanban

Scrum has sprints.
Kanban does not.

Sprint- A sprint is a pre-determined amount of time where
teams determine the work to get done


Sprit Example

1. Our team decided on  two week Sprint

2. Every two weeks, our team holds a Sprint meeting

In the srint meeting -
	Start by ddiscussing last Sprint
	What went well?
	What didn't go well?
	What can we do better next Sprint?
	Discuss and agree on the work to be comleted  
		in the next Sprint


After two weeks, hold another Sprint meeting

and keep going


----------------------------------------------

Kanban-

with kanban its an ongoing process

As you are working on things, new issues, new tickets are 
added to the board at any given time

Jira-


Issue Type-
	Story



User Story

As a <type of user>,  I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.

As a web developer, I want to be able to add users to jira
so that my coworkers can report bugs.

As a driver, I want my car's dashboard to be voice activated 
so that I ccan get directions safely while driving.

As a cashier, I want to have the total calculated for me 
so that i can give the correct change back to the customer.

No technical stuff mentioned 



Epic

An epic is a story that is too big for a single sprint. 
Its broken down into multiple user stories.
When those are done, the epic is complete.

Epic 
	-Story#1
	-Story#2
	-Story#3


Epic (core functionality of our note taking app)

	-Story#1 
		As a driver, I want my car's dashboard to be
		voice activated so that I ccan get 
		directions safely while driving.

	-Story#2
		As a web developer, I want to be able to 
		access an api so that i can extend the fun ctionality 
		of the app

	-Story#3

		my contacts so that I can collaborate with them.



Stories in jira = User stories

Team Managed Vs Company Managed projects

Team-managed projects do not require admin permissions
to create
All entities live inside the projects
Fast and easy to set up and maintain

Entities

Company-managed projects require jira administrative 
permissions to create.
Entities can be shared across other company managed projects
Global entities
Must be Jira admin to create
More complicated to set up and maintain
