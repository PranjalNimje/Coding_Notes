Block and inline boxes
In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes â€” block boxes and inline boxes. 

The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation
to other boxes on the page. 

Boxes have an inner display type and an outer display type.

In general, you can set various values for the display type using the 
display property, which can have various values.
